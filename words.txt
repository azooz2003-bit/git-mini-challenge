Hello! Welcome to today's mini-challenge.

This is a story we would like to publish: 

"In a bustling city, two friends, John and James, were part of the GT Apps club. Together, they conceived "Health First," an app promoting mental well-being. With the club's support, they transformed their idea into reality, providing users with daily mindfulness exercises and meditation guides to find calm in a chaotic world. My name is Ronit Jain and I am apart of this club now. I really enjoy it even though it hurts my head"

"The end!"
