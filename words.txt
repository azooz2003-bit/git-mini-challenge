Hello! Welcome to today's mini-challenge.

This is a story we would like to publish: 

"In a bustling city, two friends, John and Sarah, were part of the Apps Club, a community of tech enthusiasts. Together, they conceived "Health First," an app promoting mental well-being. With the club's and friends' support, they transformed their idea into reality, providing users with daily mindfulness exercises and meditation guides to find calm in a chaotic world."

"Sarah and Alex turned their app into a billion-dollar company. Anson, who was also a member of the Apps Club, decided to reach out to them in search for an internship. Thankfully, they had a spot open for an iOS developer intern, which Anson applied to immediately."
